VRTI (or VR Treadmill Interface) is a tool that enables you control your Bluetooth-enabled treadmill, and translate its movement into your game.
This allows you to take walks with your friends in VRChat, or exercise in your favourite VR (or non-VR) game.

VRTI communicates with your treadmill over Bluetooth (BLE). Please check the current list of [supported devices](/vrti/help/supported-devices) to see if your treadmill is compatible.
Currently, VRTI only supports various KingSmith WalkingPad models, but it is planned to receive FTMS support in order to support more treadmills.

Input to the game is either provided over [OSC](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview) in the case of VRChat, or by emulating a virtual Xbox (XInput) controller for other games.
The speed at which you walk in-game is determined by the speed of your treadmill.

Read on in the next section to find out how to get started.
