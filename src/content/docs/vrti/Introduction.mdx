**With VRTI (VR Treadmill Interface) you can control your Bluetooth-enabled treadmill, and translate its movement into your game.
This enables you to take walks with your friends in VRChat, or exercise in your favourite VR (or even non-VR) games.**

VRTI provides movement input to your game, either over [OSC](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview) in the case of VRChat, or by emulating a virtual Xbox controller for other games (XInput).
The speed at which you walk in-game is determined by the speed of your treadmill.

VRTI communicates with your treadmill over Bluetooth (Low Energy).
Currently, VRTI supports various KingSmith WalkingPad models, as well as most treadmills that support the Bluetooth FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) protocol.
Please check the current list of [supported devices](/vrti/help/supported-devices) to see if your treadmill is compatible.
