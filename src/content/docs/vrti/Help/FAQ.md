### My treadmill is not connecting to VRTI, what can I do?

If you treadmill is not connecting to VRTI, please ensure that:

- Your specific treadmill is a [supported device](/vrti/help/supported-devices).
- Your treadmill is plugged into power, and that its power switch is turned on.
- Your PC's Bluetooth adapter is turned on, and supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- The [correct driver](/vrti/getting-started/connecting-your-treadmill) for your treadmill is selected in the settings
  menu.
- Your treadmill is within Bluetooth range of your PC.
- Your treadmill is not currently connected to another device (e.g. your phone).
- If your motherboard has built-in bluetooth:
  - Check if the external antenna is hooked up: Using built-in bluetooth without an external antenna is often insufficient.
  - Try using one of the [recommended](/vrti/help/supported-devices) Bluetooth USB dongles: Even on high-end motherboards, the built-in bluetooth adapter is sometimes still problematic.

### Will you support _X_ treadmill?

If your treadmill isn't listed, there's still a good chance it will work with VRTI!
Many Bluetooth enabled treadmills make use of FTMS, the standard Fitness Machine protocol for Bluetooth treadmills.

If your treadmill does support bluetooth control through an app, but doesn't work with VRTI, please feel free to [contact me](/vrti/help/support). I'd be happy to take a look if your pad is something we can add support for.

### I have multiple treadmills, how do I connect to the right one?

For now, VRTI connects to the first treadmill it finds.

If you have multiple supported treadmills, make sure to only have one powered on at a time.

### This looks a lot like some Swedish company's devices!

You got it! VRTI's user interface is heavily inspired by Teenage Engineering's EP-133 K.O. II sampler.

I've been a big fan of their designs, and had been wanting to build a user interface based on them for a while. When I started building VRTI, it seemed like the right project to give it a try.

VRTI's interface is very much my love letter to Teenage Engineering's designs.
