### My treadmill is not connecting to VRTI, what can I do?

If you treadmill is not connecting to VRTI, please ensure that:

- Your specific treadmill is a [supported device](/vrti/help/supported-devices).
- Your treadmill is plugged into power, and that its power switch is turned on.
- Your PC's Bluetooth adapter is turned on.
- The [correct driver](/vrti/getting-started/connecting-your-treadmill) for your treadmill is selected in the settings menu.
- Your treadmill is within Bluetooth range of your PC.
- If you are using a desktop PC with built-in Bluetooth functionality: 
  - That any external Bluetooth antennas are secured properly, and not obstructed. Attempting to connect without attaching the external antenna is often insufficient.

### I have multiple treadmills, how do I connect to the right one?

For now, VRTI connects to the first treadmill it finds.

It is adviced that if you have multiple supported treadmills, you only have one powered on at a time.
