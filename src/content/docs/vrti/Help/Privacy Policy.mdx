This privacy policy explains how VRTI collects, uses, and protects your data.

### Analytics

VRTI collects basic anonymous usage information to help improve the software.
This data does not contain any personal information. It's completely anonymous, is not shared with third parties, and is only used for internal purposes.

The data collected is processed by [Aptabase](https://aptabase.com/), and stored within the European Union.
Please see their [privacy policy](https://aptabase.com/legal/privacy) for more information.
All analytics collected by VRTI are stored by Aptabase for up to 5 years.
You cannot request me or Aptabase to delete your data, simply because it's impossible to know what data relates to you.

### Strava Integration

VRTI offers an optional integration with [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) to sync your treadmill sessions as activities. This section describes how VRTI handles data related to this integration.

#### What data is collected

When you connect your Strava account, VRTI stores the following on our server:

- **OAuth tokens** (access token and refresh token): Used to interact with the Strava API on your behalf. These tokens are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption and are never stored in plaintext.
- **Strava athlete ID**: A numeric identifier used to associate your Strava account with your VRTI account.

VRTI does **not** store your Strava profile information (name, location, profile picture, etc.), activity history, or any other Strava data. The integration is one-way: VRTI creates activities on your Strava account, but does not read or import your existing Strava data.

#### How your data is used

Your Strava OAuth tokens are used exclusively to:

- Create activities on your Strava account when you sync treadmill sessions.
- Refresh expired access tokens to maintain your connection.

Your data is never shared with third parties, sold, or used for analytics, advertising, or any purpose other than the Strava integration functionality described above.

#### How to disconnect and delete your data

You can disconnect your Strava account at any time through VRTI's settings. When you unlink your Strava account:

1. VRTI revokes its access with Strava (deauthorization).
2. All stored OAuth tokens and connection data are permanently deleted from our server.

You can also revoke VRTI's access directly from your [Strava settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/apps).

If you would like assistance with, or request deletion of your data, please [contact me](/vrti/help/support).

### Your rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: Request information about what data we hold about you.
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of your data at any time.
- **Withdraw consent**: Disconnect the Strava integration or stop using VRTI at any time.

For any privacy-related questions or requests, please [contact me](/vrti/help/support).
