## VR Hardware

- VRTI currently only supports the PC version of VRChat. Standalone headsets are unsupported, unless used in PCVR mode.
- VR-only features only support SteamVR. Alternative runtimes are unsupported.

## Treadmills

### KingSmith

#### WalkingPad

- WalkingPad P1 <Badge text="Tested" variant="success" />
- WalkingPad A1 <Badge text="Untested" variant="caution" />
- WalkingPad R1 PRO <Badge text="Untested" variant="caution" />

Note that if you have a WalkingPad model that is not listed here, it could still work with VRTI.
If you have one, please try connecting your treadmill to VRTI and let me know if it works, so I can add it to the list!

:::note
Treadmills with FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) are planned to be supported in the future.
