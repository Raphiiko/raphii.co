## Treadmills

Here you'll find a list of treadmill models that have been tested by our community and are known to work with VRTI.
This list is maintained [here](https://github.com/Duinrahaic/treadmill-compatibility).

Note that if you have a Bluetooth-enabled treadmill that is not listed here, it could still work with VRTI!
If you have one, please try connecting your treadmill with any of the available driver options, and let me know if it works so I can add it to this list.

If your treadmill is listed here, be sure to select the recommended driver for your treadmill model in VRTI's settings.

## Bluetooth Adapters

Many Bluetooth adapters will work with VRTI, but you'll find a list here of the ones that have been tested and confirmed to work with VRTI.
If your adapter isn't listed here, there's a good chance it will still work: Generally it just needs to support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

As with the treadmills: if you have a model that is not listed here, please let me know if it works with VRTI so I can add it to the list!

:::caution[On External Antennas]
If your Bluetooth adapter supports external antennas (like those built into some desktop motherboards), make sure to use one.

Using your adapter without an external antenna often results in poor signal strength and connection issues, even in close proximity.

## VR Hardware

- VR-only features only support SteamVR. Alternative runtimes are unsupported.
- VRTI only supports the PC version of VRChat: Standalone headsets are unsupported, unless used in PCVR mode.
